<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<h5>Steaks:</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound 85% lean ground beef</li>
        <li>1/2 cup plain bread crumbs</li>
        <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons ketchup</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of dry mustard</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon soy sauce</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons salted butter</li>
    </ul>
<h5>Gravy:</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons salted butter</li>
        <li>12 large white button mushrooms, sliced</li>
        <li>1 cup diced onion</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3 cups high-quality, low-medium beef broth</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons ketchup</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
    </ul>
<h4>Directions</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Prepare the steaks: Mix ground beef, bread crumbs, egg, ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, mustard, soy sauce, pepper, and cayenne together in a mixing bowl with a fork or your hands until well combined. Cover with plastic wrap and refridgerate for at least 2 hours or overnight.</li>
    <li>When almost ready to cook the steaks, make the gravy: Melt butter in a large nonstick skillet over high heat. Add mushrooms, onion, and salt; saut√© until nicely browned, 5 to 8 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium and add flour; cook and stir for 3 minutes.</li>
    <li>Stir in broth, ketchup, and Worcestershire sauce. Increase the heat to high and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to medium and cook, stirring occasionally, until gravy thickens slightly and reduces, about 10 minutes. Taste and adjust salt as needed.</li>
    <li>Transfer gravy to a liquid measure. Scrape the pan clean with a spatula.</li>
    <li>Finish the steaks: Remove meat from the refridgerator and divide into four equal portions. Moisten hands and form each portion into a 1/2-inch-thick oval patty. Lightly season both sides of patties with salt.</li>
    <li>Melt butter in the clean skillet over medium-high heat. Add patties and cook until browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Pour in gravy and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to medium and continue to cook until gravy is piping hot and steaks are no longer pink in the center, about 5 more minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).</li>
